# The Monty Hall Problem

[Monty Hall Problem Reference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_Problem)

The first montyhall_play.py program will let you play a simple version of the classic 3-door game. Choose a door, get told of a bad door, then choose to stay with your current door or switch to the other door that's left. Intuition tells us it's a 50% chance to win, but it's not. This version will keep track of your wins/losses then calculate and print your statistics once you're done.

The montyhall_run.py program generates any amount of random automatic games. You input whether to always switch doors after a bad door is revealed and how many runs you want to generate. If running at least 100 runs (can go as high as you'd like, but north of 1,000,000 may take several minutes to run) you should start to reveal a clear statistic into the "problem" and the outcomes being ~33% to win if you stay and ~66% to win if you switch. Run it as many times as you like to show your friends that it's not a 50/50 chance ;).
