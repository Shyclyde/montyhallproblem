The Monty Hall Problem

Problem is described here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_Problem

The first program can generate any amount of iterations on whether you select a door and switch every time or stay 
every time. It will then list out your percentage win time, thus proving the "problem"

The second program will let you run this yourself, choosing a door, then choosing to stay or switch when presented with a false 
door. It will keep track of your wins/losses and calculate averages over time.
